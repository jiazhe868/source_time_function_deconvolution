Earthquake Source Time Function Deconvolution Using EGF

This Python script performs source time function (STF) deconvolution for an earthquake using an empirical Greenâ€™s function (EGF). It applies non-negative constrained deconvolution with mixed L1-L2 regularization to estimate the STF from observed seismic waveforms.

The output includes:
The deconvolved source time function (STF) saved as a SAC file.
A synthetic waveform generated by convolving the STF with the EGF.
A comparison plot showing the observed waveform, EGF, and STF, saved as a PDF.

Requirements
The script requires Python 3 and the following packages:
numpy
obspy
cvxpy
scipy
matplotlib

Usage
python decon_stf.py <complex_waveform_sac> <empirical_greens_function_sac>
where:
<complex_waveform_sac>: SAC file of the observed earthquake waveform.
<empirical_greens_function_sac>: SAC file of the EGF.
